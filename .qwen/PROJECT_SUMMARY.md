# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To implement a brain-inspired intelligent programming system based on semantic context as the first principle, using a three-layer architecture (gene library, agent network, and execution layer) with "semantic self-reference" as the core paradigm.

## Key Knowledge
- Architecture follows three layers: CoreLayer (GeneLibrary), ExpressionLayer (AgentNetwork), ExecutionLayer (ProgrammingWorldModel)
- Semantic self-reference paradigm: processing happens only at semantic level using pure strings, not structured data
- RNA Agent concept: primordial entity that both processes semantic information and performs operations (like RNA in biology)
- Gene library stores "language chains" as pure semantic strings in text files, with algorithms only accessing through agents
- Implementation requires focus on semantic flow rather than data structures
- Context management is based on "imaginary order" where code patterns, features, and behaviors are represented

## Recent Actions
- Set up project directory structure with CoreLayer, ExpressionLayer, ExecutionLayer, and their subdirectories
- Created README.md documenting the architecture and project structure
- Implemented semantic gene library using pure string storage (semantic_gene_library.py)
- Created RNA Agent as primordial entity for semantic self-reference (rna_agent.py) that can both process and operate
- Implemented agent context representing the "imaginary order" for code pattern representation
- Created configuration file defining the three activation modes (subject, passive, trigger)

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Set up the three-layer project structure (CoreLayer, ExpressionLayer, ExecutionLayer)
2. [DONE] Implement semantic gene library that stores pure semantic strings
3. [DONE] Create RNA Agent as primordial entity for semantic self-reference
4. [DONE] Implement context management based on "imaginary order" concept
5. [TODO] Wait for user to provide new framework as they plan to clear existing code and start fresh
6. [TODO] Follow user's new framework direction for semantic self-reference implementation
