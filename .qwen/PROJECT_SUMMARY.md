# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Reorganize the AVM2 project to implement a semantic bootstrapping system where intelligence emerges from the coupling of symbolic and real-world interactions through micro-Agent architecture.

## Key Knowledge
- **Three Realms Architecture**: Real (physical world feedback), Imaginary (semantic processing), Symbolic (knowledge base)
- **Micro-Agent Design**: RNA-like primitive entities with weak subjectivity, no decision-making or planning
- **System Agent Abstraction**: InputAgent/OutputAgent are abstract base classes requiring concrete implementations
- **Semantic-Persistence Separation**: YAML files describe semantic properties, Python classes implement logic
- **File Synchronization**: All Agent classes must implement sync_to_file and sync_from_file methods
- **Dynamic Type Creation**: Use eval(class_name) to create Agent instances from YAML configurations
- **Project Structure**: driver/ for core components, system_interface_agents/ for implementations, Agents/ for configurations
- **System Agent Files**: Must include class_name field in metadata for dynamic instantiation

## Recent Actions
- Fixed missing sync_from_file method in OutputAgent class
- Added complete file interaction methods to IOAgent class
- Updated SystemAgent YAML files to include class_name field (AgentCreatorOutputAgent, SystemMonitorInputAgent)
- Restored main.py to simple, runnable implementation using eval(class_name) for dynamic Agent creation
- Documented comprehensive knowledge in QWEN.md and Start.md including design principles, code standards, and engineering lessons
- Fixed import issues in system_agents.py by adding missing os import
- Validated all code syntax through testing

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze Agent semantic system vs programming language system separation
2. [DONE] Read all YAML files in Agents folder to understand semantic configurations
3. [DONE] Check file interaction code for Agent, InputAgent, and OutputAgent classes
4. [DONE] Fix OutputAgent missing sync_from_file method
5. [DONE] Add file interaction methods to IOAgent
6. [DONE] Ensure SystemAgent files contain class_name information
7. [DONE] Implement runnable main.py using eval(class_name) for dynamic Agent creation
8. [TODO] Test system startup and Agent loading in memory
9. [TODO] Verify semantic bootstrapping functionality
10. [TODO] Implement evolution mechanisms (reward events,淘汰机制)
