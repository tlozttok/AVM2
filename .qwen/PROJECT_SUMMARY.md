# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To implement a brain-inspired intelligent programming system based on semantic self-reference as the first principle, using a three-layer architecture with semantic context as the core paradigm.

## Key Knowledge
- **Architecture**: Three-layer system (Symbolic Register/Imaginary Register/Real Register) with micro-agents as RNA-like primordial entities
- **Core Paradigm**: Semantic self-reference - all processing happens at semantic level using pure strings, no structured data
- **System Interface Design**: Input/Output agents are the boundary between real and imaginary registers, serving as semantic vector to symbol system converters
- **Syntax Separation**: System agent operations use JSON syntax while regular agent messages use XML-style syntax to avoid confusion
- **Expressivity Guarantee**: New agent expressivity must be â‰¥ original system expressivity for true bootstrapping
- **Implementation Stack**: Python with asynchronous message bus and OpenAI API integration

## Recent Actions
- **Completed Agent Framework**: Implemented core Agent, MessageBus, and AgentSystem classes with asynchronous communication
- **System Interface Agents**: Created InputAgent, OutputAgent, and IOAgent for real-imaginary register boundary management
- **Strict Semantic Conversion**: Implemented rigorous validation and conversion between semantic strings and agent objects
- **Hierarchical State Queries**: Added layered system monitoring methods to prevent token explosion
- **Expressivity-Preserving Bootstrapping**: Developed mechanism ensuring system self-expansion maintains or enhances expressivity
- **Reality Validation**: Created comprehensive testing for semantic-to-real world conversion correctness
- **Learning Mechanisms**: Built agents that learn to use system interfaces through semantic descriptions

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Implement core agent framework and asynchronous message system
2. [DONE] Create system interface agents for real-imaginary register coupling
3. [DONE] Develop strict semantic conversion mechanisms with validation
4. [DONE] Implement hierarchical state query system for self-observation
5. [DONE] Ensure expressivity preservation in semantic bootstrapping
6. [DONE] Validate real-world correctness of agent creation and operation
7. [TODO] Integrate symbolic register (gene library) for semantic storage
8. [TODO] Implement movement module for code execution and physical feedback
9. [TODO] Develop evolution mechanisms (elimination, mutation, credit assignment)
10. [TODO] Create three-register coupling interfaces for full system integration
