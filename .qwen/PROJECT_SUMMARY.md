# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a semantic bootstrapping system where intelligence emerges from the coupling of symbolic and real-world interactions through micro-Agent architecture.

## Key Knowledge
- **Three Realms Architecture**: Real (physical world feedback), Imaginary (semantic processing), Symbolic (knowledge base)
- **Micro-Agent Design**: RNA-like primitive entities with weak subjectivity, no decision-making or planning
- **System Agent Abstraction**: InputAgent/OutputAgent are abstract base classes requiring concrete implementations
- **Semantic-Persistence Separation**: YAML files describe semantic properties, Python classes implement logic
- **File Synchronization**: All Agent classes must implement sync_to_file and sync_from_file methods
- **Dynamic Type Creation**: Use eval(class_name) to create Agent instances from YAML configurations
- **Project Structure**: driver/ for core components, system_interface_agents/ for implementations, Agents/ for configurations
- **Real-time File Sync**: Agent state automatically syncs to files during activation, with debug mode option
- **Message Cache Structure**: bg_message_cache now uses list[Tuple[AgentMessage, bool]] with usage tracking
- **Reduce Logic**: Messages are deduplicated based on usage status (used/unused) and sender/receiver keywords

## Recent Actions
- **Refactored System Agents**: Separated AgentCreatorOutputAgent and SystemMonitorInputAgent into independent files
- **Enhanced File Synchronization**: Updated sync methods to handle new bg_message_cache structure with usage tracking
- **Implemented Real-time Sync**: Added automatic file synchronization during Agent activation with DEBUG_MODE control
- **Improved Reduce Method**: Enhanced message deduplication logic to distinguish between used and unused messages
- **Updated Documentation**: Revised README.md to reflect current system state and new architecture
- **Created TODO Tracking**: Documented future requirements including user input Agent and system exploration Agent
- **Fixed Message Processing**: Updated activate_async to properly handle the new tuple-based message cache structure

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Refactor system Agent classes into separate files
2. [DONE] Update Agent file sync methods to include message caches
3. [DONE] Implement real-time file synchronization during Agent activation
4. [DONE] Add debug mode option to disable auto-sync in main function
5. [TODO] Add user input Agent (provide user-system interaction interface)
6. [TODO] Add system Agent exploration Agent (query available system Agents and usage)
7. [TODO] Auto-create YAML files for system Agents (automatic configuration generation)
8. [TODO] Verify semantic bootstrapping functionality
9. [TODO] Implement evolution mechanisms (reward events,淘汰机制)
