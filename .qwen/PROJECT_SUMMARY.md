# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a brain-inspired intelligent programming system based on semantic self-reference as the core paradigm, using a three-layer architecture (symbolic, imaginary, real registers) with semantic context as the first principle.

## Key Knowledge
- **Architecture**: Three registers - Symbolic (gene library), Imaginary (agent network), Real (execution layer)
- **Core Paradigm**: Semantic self-reference - all processing happens at semantic level using pure strings, no structured data
- **RNA Agent Concept**: Primordial entities that both process semantic information and perform operations
- **System Interface Agents**: InputAgent (real→imaginary conversion) and OutputAgent (imaginary→real conversion) are the boundary points between real and imaginary registers
- **Syntax Separation**: System operations use distinct syntax (JSON/command style) from regular agent messages (XML-like tags)
- **Expressivity Preservation**: New agents must have expressive power ≥ original system for true semantic bootstrapping
- **Conversion Model**: Rigorous system-theoretic model for converting between imaginary (semantic strings) and real (object instances) agent representations

## Recent Actions
- Implemented basic Agent framework with asynchronous message bus and activation mechanisms
- Created System Interface Agents (InputAgent, OutputAgent) as boundary entities between real and imaginary registers
- Established semantic conversion model ensuring expressivity equivalence in bootstrapping
- Analyzed system completeness from holistic, dynamic, interconnected perspective
- Identified critical insight: expressivity resides in imaginary register processing, not boundary conversion
- Validated core system functionality - agents can communicate, message bus operates correctly

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Set up three-layer project structure and basic agent framework
2. [DONE] Implement semantic gene library and RNA agent concept
3. [DONE] Create system interface agents for real-imaginary boundary
4. [IN PROGRESS] Design and implement distinct syntax for system operations vs regular agent messages
5. [TODO] Implement rigorous conversion mechanism between semantic strings and agent objects
6. [TODO] Ensure imaginary register agents learn to use system interface agents
7. [TODO] Validate real-world correctness of agent creation and operation
8. [TODO] Implement semantic bootstrapping with expressivity preservation guarantees
